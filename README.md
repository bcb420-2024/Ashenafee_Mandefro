# About

My name is Ashenafee üëãüèæ, and this repository houses my BCB420 coursework for the Winter 2024 term! It will be continuously updated as the term progresses.

# Wiki

You can access my wiki page [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2024/Ashenafee_Mandefro/wiki). It includes the course journal, which is where I'll be documenting my progress and efforts for this course. It will be more frequently updated than this README simply because it serves as a journal.

# Assignments

## Assignment 1

You can find the HTML output of my RMarkdown notebook for Assignment 1 [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2024/Ashenafee_Mandefro/blob/main/Assignment%201/A1_Notebook.html).

# Homework

In addition to assignments, there are also homework sets to complete. Many of these revolve around the idea of exploring new tools and techniques in BCB. You can find my work for each homework set below:
