# About

My name is Ashenafee üëãüèæ, and this repository houses my BCB420 coursework for the Winter 2024 term! It will be continuously updated as the term progresses.

# Wiki

You can access my wiki page [here](https://github.com/bcb420-2024/Ashenafee_Mandefro/wiki). It includes the course journal, which is where I'll be documenting my progress and efforts for this course. It will be more frequently updated than this README simply because it serves as a journal.

# Assignments

Below is a table of my assignments and the link to both the RMarkdown document and the HTML output generated by knitting the RMarkdown.
